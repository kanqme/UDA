            <p> 
                Electronic waste pollution does not affect everyone equally. While the benefits of technology are mainly distributed in wealthier societies, the burden of e-waste pollution often falls on the most vulnerable and marginalized communities.
            </p>
            <p> 
                On this page, we explore how e-waste impacts different communities around the world, from informal dumpsites in developing countries to urban centers in industrialized nations, and how this environmental issue intersects with social and economic justice concerns.
